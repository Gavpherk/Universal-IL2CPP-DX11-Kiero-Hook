# Universal-IL2CPP-DX11-Kiero-Hook
A template to save time hacking IL2CPP Games.

This template hooks DX11 (Can also hook DX9, DX10, DX12, OpenGL, and Vulkan) You can adjust the API version/type in kiero/kiero.h
This template also grabs the base address of the the GameAssembly module in IL2CPP games. 
This template is universal and will work on any Il2CPP Game running DX9 through DX11
All there is to do is customize the menu to your liking, and create your own SDK or however you choose to read/write memory.
